# Beat Detector and Time Stretcher
This is a Python script that performs beat detection on an audio input and time-stretches an audio output accordingly to match the beats (tempo) detected in real time.
# Notes
There is a short delay in updating the tempo of the audio output, and the script has seems to work for audio inputs in the range of 80 to 160 beats per second.
